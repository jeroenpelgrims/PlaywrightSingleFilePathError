To reproduce the error, run the following commands in this folder:
(Not sure if the first 2 are required, but just to be sure..)

1. `dotnet build`
2. `pwsh bin\Debug\net6.0\playwright.ps1 install`
3. `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained false -o publish`
4. `publish\PlaywrightSingleFilePathError.exe`

You should now see the following error:
```
Unhandled exception. System.ArgumentException: The path is empty. (Parameter 'path')
   at System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(String path)
   at System.IO.FileInfo..ctor(String originalPath, String fullPath, String fileName, Boolean isNormalized)

   at Program.<Main>(String[] args)
```

When publishing with the following command:  
`dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=false --self-contained false -o publish`
(Note the `-p:PublishSingleFile=false`)
The program runs perfectly.
